## Important Notice for Viewing Notebooks with Interactive Content

To properly view Jupyter Notebooks that contain interactive outputs, such as Folium maps and Plotly dashboards, please follow these steps:

1. Open [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
2. Navigate to the desired notebook file within this repository and copy its URL.
3. Paste the copied URL into the search field on `nbviewer` and click "Go".

By following these steps, the notebook will be rendered in `nbviewer` and the interactive elements will be displayed correctly.
